# python-version
Hi just letting you know that beside using commands in cmd or terminal you can also find out your python version by using code.

HOW TO USE :
1- honestly there's no specific tutorial for this repos cause its just a couple line of code.
2- but beside that just run the programm with your terminal or cmd using this command :
  python3 project.py
3- remember to replace the [project.py] with your python file name .
